# Support fine-grained cluster connectivity and multiple cable drivers

## Summary

Submariner currently assumes full mesh connectivity by default and provisions VPN connections between all participating
clusters. In addition, Submariner currently offers one of three cable drivers: VXLAN, IPSec or wireguard with limited
configuration options. Only one of these cable drivers is enabled across all the clusters in a cluster set, that is all
clusters that join a broker must use the same cable driver. The goal of this proposal is to outline an extended model
that will support:

- The selection of which clusters to connect and in what fashion (full mesh or connection to subset of clusters in
  a ClusterSet).
- The selection of one or more cable drivers in order to support different cable types between connected clusters.
  For example, IPSec between public and private clouds but raw VXLAN between the clusters in the same cloud.

There are use cases that involve supporting a mix of cable drivers or cable driver configurations within the same
cluster set. For example, a cluster set could contain three clusters, two that are on-premise and the other
in the cloud. Connections to the cloud cluster will need to use encryption while the on-premise clusters can use
unencrypted connections, as theyâ€™re connected by a private link, to avoid the performance overhead of encryption.
This could be achieved using either:

- Different cable driver implementations or
- The same cable driver implementation with differing configurations.

For other use cases, it makes sense to offer finer-grained connectivity options. One such use case is a client-server
scenario where multiple client clusters need to access a server cluster but the user does not want the client clusters
to connect to one another. Finer-grained connectivity could also improve overall scalability where full mesh is not
required.

## Proposal

This enhancement proposes a mechanism to allow users to specify their intent as to which clusters to connect and how to
connect them. The default would still be a full mesh with a homogeneous cable driver.

The standard mechanism in Kubernetes to specify intent is by creating a Kubernetes API resource whose effect is eventually
realized into the cluster's desired state. To extend the Kubernetes API, one could either use the generic Kubernetes
`ConfigMap` or use a custom resource definition (CRD). There's pros and cons to each but a CRD seems more suitable for
this enhancement.

This enhancement will propose a single API for finer-grained connectivity and multiple cable driver support.

### Finer-grained connectivity and multiple cable driver API

This following CRD is proposed:

```Go
type ClusterConnectionPolicies struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`

    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    Spec ClusterConnectionPolicy `json:"spec"`
}

type ClusterConnectionPolicySpec struct {
    // LeftClusterSelector identifies the Cluster resources representing the clusters on one end of a connection. An empty
    // selector indicates wildcard, ie matches any cluster.
    // Not used in combination with ClusterSelector.
    LeftClusterSelector metav1.LabelSelector `json:"leftClusterSelector,omitempty"`

    // RightClusterSelector identifies the Cluster resources representing the clusters on the other end of a connection.
    // An empty selector indicates wildcard, ie matches any cluster.
    // Not used in combination with ClusterSelector.
    RightClusterSelector metav1.LabelSelector `json:"rightClusterSelector,omitempty"`

    // ClusterSelector identifies the Cluster resources representing a subset of clusters. 
    // Not used in combination with LeftClusterSelector or RightClusterSelector.
    // An empty selector indicates wildcard, ie matches any cluster.
    ClusterSelector metav1.LabelSelector `json:"clusterSelector,omitempty"`

    // Topology identifies the connection topology for the cable ends: full-mesh/point-to-point/client-server.
    Topology `json:"topology,omitempty"`

   // Priority identifies the priority for the connection policy. Higher priorities are applied first.
    Priority  *int  `json:"priority,omitempty"`

    // ConnectionPolicy identifies the default connection policy if no policies are found: to connect or no-connect.
    ConnectionPolicy *string `json:"connectionPolicy,omitempty"`

    Spec CableDriverSpec `json:"spec"`
}

type CableDriverSpec struct {
    // Name of the cable driver implementation.
    Name string `json:"name"`

    // Options specifies key/value configuration parameters for the cable driver.
    Options *v1.ConfigMap `json:"options,omitempty"`
}
```

The `ClusterConnectionPolicies` CR defines the criteria for selecting which cluster pairs/subsets can connect and associated optional
configuration options to use for each cluster connection. To resolve the connectivity policy for a remote cluster's Endpoint,
Submariner would:  

- Search for a policy whose left and right label selectors match the corresponding Cluster resources of the local
and remote Endpoints.
- Search for a policy whose cluster label selector match the corresponding Cluster resources of the local and remote Endpoints.

If any matching policy is found, the clusters are either:

- connected (based on the connectionPolicy) according to the specified topology in the policy. Or
- not connected (based on the connectionPolicy).

If more than one matching policy is found, the priority field is used to determine which policy to use. If policies of equal priority are found
it's assumed that these policies are to be applied in parallel.

If no matching policy is found, the default cable driver and default connection policy are used. This policy can be auto-created at broker
deploy time and should specify the cable, the connection policy (to connect or not connect nodes that don't match predefined
policies) as well as the preferred topology. If the default policy is not to connect nodes that don't match the selector criteria, then
a topology and default cable are not needed.

> **_NOTE:_**  the `ConnectionPolicy` field can also be used to specify policies for which clusters not to connect.
> **_NOTE:_** In the case of multiple labels being specified, the selector will need to match all the labels. Equality-based requirements will
be supported. For e.g. labels such as `env: !production` will match any clusters that aren't labelled with `env: production`.

Defining separate resources for each policy and defining a priority or precedence field, allows Submariner to prioritize the
connectivity and cable type between a pair of clusters.

The `ClusterConnectionPolicies` resources would be created and maintained on the broker cluster and synced to each participating cluster.
A controller to reconcile updates to policies will need to be implemented in Submariner.

### Labelling clusters

Clusters are defined as Custom Resources and can be labeled in the CR definition, or after creation using kubectl. A new parameter to label
clusters at `subctl join` time could also be added for usability purposes.

### Policy management with subctl

The `ClusterConnectionPolicies` can be created as the Broker deployment through the extension of submariner configuration YAML to include
parameters that support policy creation.

The `ClusterConnectionPolicies` can be created/managed after Broker deployment through kubectl or subctl using a command such as:

```cmd
subctl connection-policy add | list | delete | export
```

> **_NOTE:_** If a policy CR is created by a cluster admin using kubectl - it will need to be synced to the Broker.

#### Connection Policy Examples

- we want to specify a default connection policy that uses a full-mesh topology with IPsec as the default cable driver.

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: public-internet
spec:
  connectionPolicy: connect
  topology: full-mesh
  cableDriver: 
    name: "ipsec"
  priority: 0
```

- we want to specify a default connection policy that uses a doesn't connect clusters.

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: public-internet
spec:
  connectionPolicy: no-connect
  priority: 0
```

- We want to use specific cable drivers to connect clusters in a cluster set as shown in the image below. We
label the `Clusters` appropriately and define a number of policies with the appropriate label selectors.

![Finer grained connectivity example](./images/multiple_cables_ep.png)

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: on-prem
spec:
  leftClusterSelector:
    location: on-premise
  rightClusterSelector:
    location: on-premise
  topology: point-to-point
  connectionPolicy: connect
  cableDriver:
    name:  "vxlan"
  priority: 3
```

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: on-prem-to-cloud
spec:
  leftClusterSelector:
    location: on-premise
    env: production
  rightClusterSelector:
    location: cloud
    env: production
  topology: point-to-point
  connectionPolicy: connect
  cableDriver:
    name:  "ipsec"
  priority: 3
```

> **_NOTE:_** we could have just used the `env: production` label in the example above.

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: cloud-a-default
spec:
  clusterSelector:
    location: cloud
  topology: full-mesh
  cableDriver:
    name:  "vxlan"
  priority: 3
```

- We don't want to connect two clusters in a `ClusterSet`. We label the `Clusters` appropriately and define a policy with the appropriate
label selectors.

```yaml
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: on-prem-to-cloud-no-connect
spec:
  leftClusterSelector:
    location: on-premise
    env: production
  rightClusterSelector:
    location: cloud
    env: production
  connectionPolicy: no-connect
  priority: 3
```

- We only want certain clusters to access a database server in another cluster and no other clusters to connect to one another. We
label the server and client `Clusters` appropriately and define a single policy with corresponding label selectors. Since there's
no other policy to match client cluster pairs, they will not be connected.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: client-server-policy
spec:
  leftClusterSelector:
    database-role: server
  rightClusterSelector:
    database-role: client
  topology: client-server
  connectionPolicy: connect
  cableDriver:
      name:  "vxlan"
   priority: 3
```

- We want any cluster to access a database server in another cluster but no other clusters to connect. We label the server
`Cluster` appropriately and define a single policy with the corresponding label selector and an empty selector to match all.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterConnectionPolicies
metadata:
  name: client-server-policy
spec:
  leftClusterSelector:
    database-server: true
  rightClusterSelector:
  topology: client-server
  connectionPolicy: connect
  cableDriver:
      name:  "vxlan"
   priority: 3
```

### Multiple Cable driver configuration

The cable driver configuration in Submariner is relatively limited, as one can only select one driver to use at a time and thereâ€™s minimal
support for customization of the configuration. The goals of this proposal for the extension of the cable driver configuration are:

- Maintain backward compatibility with the current cable driver configuration
- Create a custom cable driver configuration that allows for the setup of one, many or combined drivers. In addition, the configuration
should allow for further customizations based on the selected driver(s).

Cable driver configuration parameters fall into two categories based on their scope:

- Gateway Pod Local - these are parameters that hold configuration parameters specific to each Pod (values vary from Pod to Pod).
- Namespace Local - these are configuration parameters that you would like to share across a namespace (in this case the submariner-operator
namespace).

The proposed approach for additional submariner cable driver configuration parameters is:

- To continue to use the existing environment variables injected into the Gateway Pod (with the exception of PSKs/secrets). These environment
variables will come from the `submariner.io_submariners.yaml`.
- To extend `submariner.io_submariners.yaml` with some new global parameters for cable driver configuration in a cluster set.
- To use a volume mounted ConfigMap for more detailed cable driver configurations (as these may vary).
- To use mounted secrets for parameters that need to be protected, e.g. the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and to abandon the use of environment variables
for secrets.

It's important to consider the benefit of volume mounted ConfigMaps and Secrets versus their use as environment variables injected into the Pod.
With volume mounted maps/secrets, updates are automatically reflected in the Pod, so cable driver configurations can be updated and
acted on without having to restart the Gateway Pod. The cable driver itself may need to be restarted which may have implications on existing/active
traffic flows. The ConfigMap can be marked as `optional` to avoid blocking Pod startup. Environment variables are not updated after a ConfigMap
or Secret update; The whole Pod will need to be restarted to deal with any configuration changes to environment variables.

> **_NOTE:_** As secrets are used in Submariner it's also critical to ensure the Secrets are encrypted in ETCD.

#### Multiple cable driver configuration

The proposed global configuration parameter extensions to `submariner.io_submariners.yaml` to configure multiple cable drivers are listed
in the following table:

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->
| Parameter name              | Description
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cableDrivers                | An array of strings listing the drivers to configure as separate cables.
| combinedCableDrivers        | An array of strings listing the drivers to configure as a combined cable e.g vxlan + IPSEC in transport mode
| cableDriverCustomConfig     | The name of the ConfigMap for custom driver configuration.
| cableDriverCustomConfigPath | The path to the mounted ConfigMap volume.
<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

The specification additions to `submariner.io_submariners.yaml` are shown below:

```yaml
cableDrivers:
  items:
    type: string
  type: array
combinedCableDrivers:
  items:
    type: string
  type: array
cableDriverCustomConfig:
  properties:
    configMapName:
      type: string
    namespace:
      type: string
  type: object
cableDriverCustomConfigPath:
  type: string
```

> **_NOTE:_** the existing `cableDriver` parameter when used in combination with the new parameters can be interpreted as the default/fallback
driver.

An example of a ConfigMap being used for additional VXLAN driver configuration is shown below:

```yaml
â€‹â€‹apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cable-driver-config
  namespace: submariner-operator
data:
  CableCustomConfig: |
  vxlanID: 100
```
